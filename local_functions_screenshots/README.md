Problems with IBM CLoud Functions

It appears that learners who are creating new IBM Cloud accounts are encountering this issue. We've developed a new method to obtain the endpoints. Here are the Step-by-step instructions to 
Implement Endpoints Through Theia Lab

If you encounter any challenges during the implementation of the changes, please don't hesitate to let us know.

Additionally, Ensure that you take screenshots of every step. URLs may not work if the server is not running, so screenshots are essential for documentation. Once you have finished the Capstone project upload the complete set of screenshots to your GitHub repository, and then provide the link of your repository during the peer review when asked for the endpoint URL. After submitting the final assignment, kindly share the link with us. We will review your assignment. Thank you for your cooperation
